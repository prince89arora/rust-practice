# Variables

`let` can be used to declare variables.

```
let bunnies = 2
```
- Variables can be declared without explicit types.
- Rust is strongly types language but it allows us to leave type for a variable when rust can identify the type.

```
let binnues: i32 = 2
```
- To declare type `:` is used.

**To declare multiple variables**

```
let (foo, bar) = (8,10);
```

- Data on right hand side can be de-structured to initialize variables on left hand side.
- Also called tuple pattern.
